## How Scoring Works

### Scoring Rules

First6 uses a simple point system for touchdown predictions:

| Prediction Type              | Points   | Description                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **First Touchdown (FTD)**    | 3 points | Your player scores the first touchdown of the game             |
| **Anytime Touchdown (ATTD)** | 1 point  | Your player scores any touchdown during the game               |
| **Both FTD + ATTD**          | 4 points | Your player scores the first touchdown (you get both bonuses!) |
| **No Touchdown**             | 0 points | Your player doesn't score any touchdowns                       |

### How Picks Are Graded

1. **Automatic Grading**: After each game ends, our system automatically fetches the game results and grades all picks for that game.

2. **Timing**: Picks are typically graded within 30 minutes after the game ends. The system runs:

   - Sundays at 4:30 PM EST (after early games)
   - Sundays at 8:30 PM EST (after late games)
   - Additional runs as needed for other game days

3. **Win or Loss**:
   - If your player scores any touchdown, your pick is marked as a **WIN** ✅
   - If your player doesn't score, your pick is marked as a **LOSS** ❌

### Scoring Examples

#### Example 1: First Touchdown Scorer

You pick **Patrick Mahomes** and he scores the first touchdown of the game.

- **FTD Points**: 3 (first touchdown)
- **ATTD Points**: 1 (scored a touchdown)
- **Total**: 4 points ✅ WIN

#### Example 2: Anytime Touchdown (Not First)

You pick **Travis Kelce** and he scores a touchdown in the 3rd quarter (but not the first TD of the game).

- **FTD Points**: 0 (not first touchdown)
- **ATTD Points**: 1 (scored a touchdown)
- **Total**: 1 point ✅ WIN

#### Example 3: No Touchdown

You pick **Tyreek Hill** but he doesn't score any touchdowns.

- **FTD Points**: 0
- **ATTD Points**: 0
- **Total**: 0 points ❌ LOSS

#### Example 4: Multiple Touchdowns

You pick **Christian McCaffrey** and he scores 3 touchdowns (including the first one).

- **FTD Points**: 3 (first touchdown)
- **ATTD Points**: 1 (scored touchdowns - only counted once!)
- **Total**: 4 points ✅ WIN

**Note**: Even if your player scores multiple touchdowns, you only get 1 ATTD point. The FTD bonus is what makes picking the first scorer so valuable!

#### Example 5: Zero Touchdown Game

You pick **Josh Allen** but the game ends 3-0 with only field goals.

- **FTD Points**: 0 (no touchdowns in game)
- **ATTD Points**: 0 (no touchdowns in game)
- **Total**: 0 points ❌ LOSS

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: When are picks graded?**

A: Picks are automatically graded shortly after games end. The system runs on Sundays at 4:30 PM and 8:30 PM EST, plus additional times for games on other days. You'll typically see results within 30 minutes of the game ending.

**Q: Can I change my pick after the game starts?**

A: No, picks are locked once the game's kickoff time has passed. Make sure to submit your picks before kickoff!

**Q: What happens if I don't make a pick for a game?**

A: No problem! You're not required to pick every game. Only games where you submit a pick will count toward your score.

**Q: How is my total score calculated?**

A: Your total score is the sum of points from all your **winning picks** only. Losses don't subtract points - they just don't add any.

### Scoring Questions

**Q: My player scored 3 touchdowns. Do I get 3 ATTD points?**

A: No, you only get 1 ATTD point regardless of how many touchdowns your player scores. However, if they scored the first touchdown, you get the 3-point FTD bonus plus the 1 ATTD point for a total of 4 points.

**Q: What if no one scores a touchdown in the game?**

A: If a game ends with no touchdowns (only field goals), all picks for that game are marked as losses with 0 points. This is rare but can happen in defensive battles!

**Q: Can I get FTD points without ATTD points?**

A: No. If a player scores the first touchdown, they automatically scored "any" touchdown, so you always get both FTD (3) and ATTD (1) points for a total of 4 points.

**Q: What if there's a defensive touchdown first?**

A: Only offensive touchdowns count for scoring. If a defensive player scores the first touchdown, the first _offensive_ touchdown scorer is used for FTD scoring.

**Q: My pick shows "Pending" even though the game ended. Why?**

A: The game may not have been scored yet. This can happen if:

- The scoring system is waiting for the scheduled run time
- There was an issue fetching game data
- The game just ended very recently

If your pick is still pending more than an hour after the game ended, contact an administrator.

### Viewing Results Questions

**Q: Where can I see who scored the first touchdown?**

A: Click on any game in your picks list to see the game results modal. It shows the first touchdown scorer and all touchdown scorers for that game.

**Q: Can I see other users' picks?**

A: No, picks are private. You can only see your own picks and results. However, you can see everyone's total scores on the leaderboard.

**Q: How do I know if my pick was correct?**

A: Your pick will show a ✅ WIN badge if your player scored, or a ❌ LOSS badge if they didn't. You'll also see the points earned and a breakdown of FTD and ATTD points.

**Q: What does the win percentage mean?**

A: Your win percentage is calculated as: (Wins ÷ Total Picks) × 100. For example, if you have 10 wins and 5 losses (15 total picks), your win percentage is 66.7%.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What if the scoring is wrong?**

A: If you believe your pick was scored incorrectly:

1. Check the game results to see who actually scored touchdowns
2. Verify your pick was for the correct player
3. Contact an administrator with your pick ID and details

Administrators can review and correct scoring if there was an error.

**Q: Can administrators change my score?**

A: Administrators can override scores only to correct errors or resolve disputes. All overrides are logged with timestamps and admin IDs for transparency.

**Q: What happens if the game data is wrong?**

A: If there's an issue with the game data from our data source, administrators can manually score the game with the correct touchdown information. Your picks will be re-graded with the accurate data.

**Q: Is my data secure?**

A: Yes! First6 is self-hosted and designed for private groups. Your picks and scores are only visible to you and administrators of your group.

### Strategy Questions

**Q: Should I always pick the same player?**

A: That's up to you! Some strategies:

- **High-volume scorers**: Pick players who score frequently (higher chance of ATTD)
- **First-play specialists**: Pick players who get early touches (higher chance of FTD)
- **Diversify**: Pick different players each week to spread risk

**Q: Is it better to pick a running back or wide receiver?**

A: Both can be good choices! Consider:

- **Running backs**: Often get goal-line carries (good for touchdowns)
- **Wide receivers**: Can score from anywhere on the field
- **Tight ends**: Underrated red-zone targets
- **Quarterbacks**: Can score rushing touchdowns

**Q: What's a good win percentage?**

A: Touchdown scoring is unpredictable! A win percentage above 50% is solid, and above 60% is excellent. Remember, even the best players don't score every game.

**Q: Should I pick players from my favorite team?**

A: That's a personal choice! Picking your favorite team's players can make games more exciting, but don't let bias cloud your judgment. Pick players you think will actually score!
